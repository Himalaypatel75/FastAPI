## Getting Started

To get started with the course, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd fastapi-course
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the App

You can run the FastAPI app using [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/). Use the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This command will start the FastAPI application, and the `--reload` option will enable automatic reloading of the server when code changes are detected.

## Swagger Documentation

FastAPI comes with built-in Swagger documentation for your API. You can access it by opening the following URL in your web browser:

[Swagger Docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

This interactive documentation will help you explore and test the API endpoints easily.
